# Open Standards Board September 2013

## Context
This was the second meeting of the Open Standards Board, and the first where they would be considering proposals that had been through the agreed process on the Standards Hub.

## Summary of outcomes
The Board agreed:
1. To adopt HTTP v1.1 and URL as open standards in relation to the persistent resolvable identifiers challenge
2. To adopt UTF-8 and Unicode 6.2 as open standards in relation to the cross-platform character encoding challenge 
3. To request a redefined challenge with a clearer scope relating to describing and sharing our information, based on a specific use case
4. For the panel chairs to form a workshop to assess which of the suggested challenges to consider next

## Declarations of interest
Before each meeting attendees are asked to declare any interests relating to the topics being covered. The following interests were declared:
1. Liam Maxwell declared that his interests remained unchanged from the first meeting 
2. Jeni Tennison declared that she had led the work to develop two of the three draft standards profiles being considered

## Discussion topic 1: Persistent resolvable identifiers challenge (Nicholas Oughtibridge, Chair of the Data Standards Panel)
When persistent resolvable identifiers were required, the data standards panel endorsed the recommendation from the challenge owner, Jeni Tennison of the ODI, to use HTTP v1.1 and Universal Resource Locators (URLs). It also agreed that departments would need further standards profiles and guidance before this profile could be implemented and departments could build the necessary identifiers.  This would need to be resistant to change over time. The Board requested a change to the draft profile to make it clearer that it could not be implemented until these additional pieces of work had been completed.

The group discussed the level of data that identifiers would be used at, and the possible impact on government resources of publishing all identifiers.  It was acknowledged that this standards profile was not prescribing the use of persistent resolvable identifiers where they did not exist already.  Instead, it was stating the standards that should be adhered to when persistent resolvable identifiers are published for government data. The issue of affordability would be considered through existing business case and comply or explain processes.

There was also discussion relating to other standards that could be used, such as digital object identifiers (DOIs). There was agreement that the draft standards profile should be updated to reflect why DOIs are not considered suitable in this particular context.
The panel recommended that the draft standards profile be adopted as compulsory, under the comply or explain principle.

**Decision: The Board advised the chair to adopt HTTP v1.1 and URL as open standards in relation to the persistent resolvable identifiers challenge. The chair agreed and adopted the standards profile, with amendments.**


## Discussion topic 2: Cross-platform character encoding challenge (Peter Grzeszczak, Chair of the Technical Standards Panel)
Peter described the initial challenge and stated that the recommendation from the panel was to agree the challenge owner’s (Jeni Tennison, ODI) proposal to adopt UTF-8 and Unicode 6.2 as open standards in cross-platform character encoding in government.
The Board noted that these standards were already widely used but asked why UTF-16 wasn’t being recommended. After discussion, the Board agreed that although UTF-16 includes more characters from other languages, the majority of the characters in use in the UK are covered by UTF-8. They recognised that the cost of the additional file sizes that UTF-16 would generate meant it was less suitable than UTF-8. For cases where non-UTF-8 characters were likely to be required on a regular basis, on this basis of user needs, this could be handled through the comply or explain process.

Questions were raised about whether this standards profile covered data within databases.  The group agreed that databases needed to be able to consume and produce text in UTF-8, however the way in which data was stored within them was out of scope. The standards profile should be updated to make this point clear.

**Decision: The Board advised the chair to adopt UTF-8 and Unicode 6.2 as open standards in relation to the cross-platform character encoding challenge. The chair agreed and adopted the standards profile, with amendments.**

## Discussion topic 3: Describing and sharing our information challenge (Nicholas Oughtibridge, Chair of the Data Standards Panel)
Nicholas described the scope of this challenge as relating to information containers, rather than individual data points.  The characteristics to be identified were title, identifier, date, creator and rights, including copyright in terms of ownership and licensing.  For closed publications, two additional elements should be identified in government: security classification and author.
The Board discussed the potential difficulties around metadata on rights.  This is a complex area where it would be difficult to define succinctly without reference to a rights statement. This should be considered. However, if the intention is only to point to a licence, then the licence property ought to be used rather than the rights property.

The group acknowledged that civil servants have a general obligation under the Public Records Act to dispose of or preserve records in the long term, and that rights would play a part in determining the action taken and the timescale.

The Board welcomed that the proposal’s aim to simplify an existing standard that is burdensome but considered that the draft profile should be clarified and separated into two components: a minimum metadata set and an open standard for its expression, and a standards profile to support the management of vocabularies in a distributed environment.
The Board recommended that this proposal required a tighter scope to relate back to the Public Records Act more specifically, with greater focus on the requirements for archiving.

**Decision: The Board requested that the scope of the describing and sharing our information challenge should be clarified. The chair requested that it be related to a specific use case and opened again for comments through the Standards Hub so that all stakeholders can consider options for the appropriate open standards to use in that context before a new recommendation is submitted to the Board.**

## Discussion topic 4: Feedback on the process
Linda shared some feedback on the process to select open standards that GDS had gathered from those involved. The Board agreed that a library of responses should be created for the generic assessment questions, such as those on maintenance organisations, that could be maintained by GDS, published on the Standards Hub and reused across future challenges. This would need to be reviewed and updated regularly.

The Board agreed that less time should be spent on the challenge and response phase and more time on the proposal phase to generate more feedback as proposals develop. Challenge owners need to be proactive in getting messages to stakeholders and the scope of challenges should be more clearly defined so that they may respond more easily. GDS will update guidance for challenge owners to reflect this and gather a list of networks and channels that challenge owners can consider using to help reach their users.

The Board also discussed whether there could be a faster process for those standards profiles that were unlikely to cause a great debate. The Board considered this but thought it better to wait until patterns begin to form as more challenges pass through the process.

# Discussion topic 5: Future challenges
At the time of the meeting, there were 5 more active challenges, and 13 challenges that had been suggested by members of the public.
It was suggested that panel chairs should form a group to review the remaining active challenges to see if their scope was appropriate, and to look over the suggested challenges to see whether new active challenges could be taken forward based on these suggestions.

**Decision: The Board agreed that the panel chairs should form a group to assess which of the suggested challenges to consider next.**
